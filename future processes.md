## Future Processes to add

I plan to include a lot of processes to produce certain goods, but not all of these have been added yet.

### Leather
1.  Leather depends on the access and processing of Tannin. Tannin is a chemical find in certain plant leaves and barks.
2.  Players will boil these Tannin-containing items to get a weak Tannin solution.
3.  Five weak Tannin solution buckets will need to be boiled down into a concentrated Tannin solution.
4.  Animal skins will have to be died, then cleaned, then left in the Tannin solution for a long time. The Tannin process usually takes 6-12 months; we'll call this 1 hour of game time.

### Wine
1.  Wine is an important material for early civilizations. It is sterile and can be stored for long term use. Even diluted wine (aka peasants wine) is better to drink than creek water
2.  Players will need to grow grapes. Grapes naturally develop yeast on them, and also something else that creates vinegar
3.  Once grapes are fully grown, they can smash them with their feet. We will provide a juice-smasher ceramic thing that drains juices into a jar.
4.  Jars will need to be sealed and left to sit for a time, let's say 20 minutes. There is a 1 in 5 chance that the jar will produce wine; the others will become vinegar
5.  Jars that produced wine (and not vinegar) can be used for wine making again, this time having 100% chance of making wine
