Notes on how to use Git

Saving local master copy to Github: 'git push'

It's been a while since I've done any freelancing, but I want to get back into it. I have been programming for over 20
years, dating all the way back to high school where I learned QBasic. Now, my specialty is web applications;
I focus on the functionality of a website over the aesthetics. My strongest skills are React.js for front end, and
PHP for back end. I can use other tools (node.js, JQuery, React Native) if you need them, and I am not afraid to learn
new tools if the job needs them. For me, no job is too big or small.
Unfortunately, time may become an issue. My current job has been running overtime regularly for months now, with no signs
of letting up. I can still offer 4 hours every week, and I will try to increase that if I'm able. I usually don't get
home until after 5:30, I'll be unable to communicate until then.
If you're still interested, my rate is $15/hr; I think that charging by the hour is the most fair exchange for the work I
put in. Feel free to message me here at any time, and I will work with you to determine the best way to service your needs.
