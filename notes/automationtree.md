# Settlers & Warlords Automation Path

Players will need to rely on automation to simplify operations of common tasks, thus freeing themselves enough to advance onto more challenging tasks

1. First power source will be from water wheels. This will provide only low level power for simple jobs, needing only planks and sticks. Players will be able to automate item movement - some of them unmovable by humans alone. But more load from this will slow down everything using it
2. Livestock can be used as a power source as well. While it can only be as good as a water wheel, it can be set up anywhere
3. Bronze is not a good metal for steam boiling - it is too brittle. Iron / Wrought Iron isn't good either, it pits and has a short life. Steam will become available only when steel can be made
4. Steam will open up a wealth of new automation options. The strengths of Steel will also benefit players. Washing, crushing and centrifuging ores can be automated... To a degree
5. Basic electric motors will provide a new means to do work. These can be powered by any number of sources, depending on the motorâ€™s power requirements
6. Circuits will provide a new level of control over motor functions, controlling motor speeds and operation timing, all automatically
7. Batteries will provide more ways to store energy for motors. Large tasks can be completed without stopping other operations
8. Artificial intelligence will enable greater levels of automation
