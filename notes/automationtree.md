# Settlers & Warlords Automation Path

Players will need to rely on automation to simplify operations of common tasks, thus freeing themselves enough to advance onto more challenging tasks

1. First power source will be from water wheels, or worker's manpower. This will provide only low level power for simple jobs, needing only planks and sticks. Players will be able to automate item movement - some of them unmovable by humans alone. But more load from this will slow down everything using it
2. Wind mills will be available early on as well, but might not offer as much power production as water wheels. These will need to be placed in high locations, that have a lot of wind
3. Livestock can be used as a power source as well. While it can only be as good as a water wheel, it can be set up anywhere. It can also scale better, too; if the user needs more power, just add more animals and harnesses
4. Another potential power source would be from vertical turbines. These can be set up in towers, using multiple layers. A fire will be placed at the bottom, forcing hot air up through the tower, rotating the fan blades
5. Bronze is not a good metal for steam boiling - it is too brittle. Iron / Wrought Iron isn't good either, it pits and has a short life. Steam will become available only when steel can be made
6. Steam will open up a wealth of new automation options. The strengths of Steel will also benefit players. Washing, crushing and centrifuging ores can be automated... To a degree
7. Basic electric motors will provide a new means to do work. These can be powered by any number of sources, depending on the motorâ€™s power requirements
8. Circuits will provide a new level of control over motor functions, controlling motor speeds and operation timing, all automatically
9. Batteries will provide more ways to store energy for motors. Large tasks can be completed without stopping other operations
10. Artificial intelligence will enable greater levels of automation

Later automation should focus on the means to produce power, and the processes of creating equipment.

-   Renewable power sources should be limited in their total power production. For example, the production process for solar panels should be long and expensive; possibly useful for a remote base using limited power, but not near enough power for any kind of industrial plant
-   Small-process fuel sources should be costly to create and maintain
-   Batteries will be large, heavy and expensive to produce. Single-use batteries will be cheaper or lighter (suitable for vehicles), but not both. Late-stage batteries will have greater capacity at the expense of higher-costing materials (and the processes to access them)
-   All machines will have a large cost to producing them. No next-level machines should be easy to access! This will push players to put more focus on expanding power production (and the means to collect fuels)
-   Gregtech relies on lava for a large portion of power, then later for accessing Tungsten; The Nether provides endless supplies of lava. I am not sure what to do about that in this game.
