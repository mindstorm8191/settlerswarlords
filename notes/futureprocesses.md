## Future Processes to add

I plan to include a lot of processes to produce certain goods, but not all of these have been added yet.

### Leather

1.  Leather depends on the access and processing of Tannin. Tannin is a chemical found in certain plant leaves and barks.
2.  Players will boil these Tannin-containing items to get a weak Tannin solution. Players will need clay pots before they can boil anything
3.  Five weak Tannin solution buckets will need to be boiled down into a concentrated Tannin solution.
4.  Animal skins will have to be died, then cleaned, then left in the Tannin solution for a long time. The Tannin process usually takes 6-12 months; we'll call this 1 hour of game time.

### Wine

1.  Wine is an important material for early civilizations. It is sterile and can be stored for long term use. Even diluted wine (aka peasants wine) is better to drink than creek water
2.  Players will need to grow grapes. Grapes naturally develop yeast on them, and also something else that creates vinegar
3.  Once grapes are fully grown, they can smash them with their feet. We will provide a juice-smasher ceramic thing that drains juices into a jar.
4.  Jars will need to be sealed and left to sit for a time, let's say 20 minutes. There is a 1 in 5 chance that the jar will produce wine; the others will become vinegar
5.  Jars that produced wine (and not vinegar) can be used for wine making again, this time having 100% chance of making wine

### Torches

1.  Torches will be necessary for underground exploration, beyond using a Fire Miner
2.  Torches, in reality, can be made from many different sources. For this we will use a short stick, a unit of dried straw, and a flamable liquid; the earliest available source is animal fats, captured from a grease pan under the Campfire.
3.  Torches will only last a minute or two

### Mining

1.  How do you mind without a pickaxe? The secret is Thermal Shock.
2.  Players will clear out an area of rock they wish to mine into.
3.  They'll then set up a fire, and let it run for a while, allowing the Rock to get really hot.
4.  Once the Rock is hot enough, they'll douse the for with lots of water (let's say 5 buckets).
5.  The sudden temperature change of the Rock will cause it to burst, breaking into chunks and gravel. (I hope to show a sound effect bubble on the map when this happens)
6.  The gravel and rocks will be cleared away using a shovel and crane and a crane. This will get them about 6 inches deeper into the rock. It'll be a long process to dig down to anything of value
7.  Players will be able to use the gravel for making paths, and the stones for building walls or other things

### Early metals - iron

1.  Players will be able to collect ores of a lot of different metals. Each will need a different process to refine.
2.  Iron can be smelted directly from its ore, but will give Pig Iron. This will contain a lot of carbon and silicon impurities.
3.  Pig Iron can be heated and hammered more to produce Wrought Iron. This may be a lengthy process.

### Vacuum tube production

1.  The wire setup is created and a glass 'dome' aka tube is made. Crafting these parts is straight-forward
2.  A glass pipe is inserted into the tube and the tube is sealed, still full of air with the tube sticking out
3.  The pipe is put onto a vacuum system to suck out as much air as possible
4.  While sealed, the pipe is heated and that seals the tube
5.  An iodizer inside the tube (such as clean copper) is then heated by way of induction. Oxidization collects the remaining gas atoms inside the tube, achieving a complete vacuum

-   We don't have to know fully how the vacuum system works

### Foliage regrowth

This one is a little different, as it's not directly controlled by the player

-   All land tiles will have a specific land type that nature will progress towards the tile having
-   Workers can clear lands, flood it with toxins, etc, but eventually nature will lead this land back to its original form (that being said, it could take several years in realtime to reach that, but still)
-   Structures built by the player will eventually decay into rubble, then get overrun with plants, and then convert back to the original tile type it was
-   Workers travelling across the same tile multiple times will also cause the lands to take wear damage, expecially grasslands. The effects will first remove grass items until there is none left. Once empty, the tile type will change to a muddied grass tile (we may have several iterations of this), then a full dirt tile. If these tiles are left undisturbed for a time, it will revert back to its original state
-   It may be more realistic to have tiles cycle naturally, aka trees & other plants grow and die at a steady rate. But this would become much more complex than the scope of this game should cover.

### Notes on tutorials

-   Good tutorials enagage the player as they go along
-   Complex games should spread tutorial coverage out, allowing the player to play the game for a time before introducing new concepts. Too many concepts at the start of the game leaves the players uninterested and won't learn
-   Guides during the game (to warn of impending dangers) is helpful
-   Providing documentation about subjects throughout the game is also helpful. Players can refer to them whenever needed
-   Pictures or animations can be more effective than trying to describe things

### Notes on crafting systems

-   Breaks down into 3 parts: Resource collection, crafting, and usage
-   Collection cannot be too tedious, or players will not enjoy doing it. Automation of this process will help greatly
-   Crafting needs to be engaging
-   Usage has to be important. Players don't want to spend an hour collecting & crafting boring decorations. There needs to be real benefits to completing the target crafting
