## Future Processes to add

I plan to include a lot of processes to produce certain goods, but not all of these have been added yet.

### Leather

1.  Leather depends on the access and processing of Tannin. Tannin is a chemical found in certain plant leaves and barks.
2.  Players will boil these Tannin-containing items to get a weak Tannin solution. Players will need clay pots before they can boil anything
3.  Five weak Tannin solution buckets will need to be boiled down into a concentrated Tannin solution.
4.  Animal skins will have to be died, then cleaned, then left in the Tannin solution for a long time. The Tannin process usually takes 6-12 months; we'll call this 1 hour of game time.

### Wine

1.  Wine is an important material for early civilizations. It is sterile and can be stored for long term use. Even diluted wine (aka peasants wine) is better to drink than creek water
2.  Players will need to grow grapes. Grapes naturally develop yeast on them, and also something else that creates vinegar
3.  Once grapes are fully grown, they can smash them with their feet. We will provide a juice-smasher ceramic thing that drains juices into a jar.
4.  Jars will need to be sealed and left to sit for a time, let's say 20 minutes. There is a 1 in 5 chance that the jar will produce wine; the others will become vinegar
5.  Jars that produced wine (and not vinegar) can be used for wine making again, this time having 100% chance of making wine

### Torches

1.  Torches will be necessary for underground exploration, beyond using a Fire Miner
2.  Torches, in reality, can be made from many different sources. For this we will use a short stick, a unit of dried straw, and a flamable liquid; the earliest available source is animal fats, captured from a grease pan under the Campfire.
3.  Torches will only last a minute or two

### Mining

1.  How do you mine without a pickaxe? The secret is Thermal Shock.
2.  Players will clear out an area of rock they wish to mine into.
3.  They'll then set up a fire, and let it run for a while, allowing the Rock to get really hot.
4.  Once the Rock is hot enough, they'll douse the for with lots of water (let's say 5 buckets).
5.  The sudden temperature change of the Rock will cause it to burst, breaking into chunks and gravel. (I hope to show a sound effect bubble on the map when this happens)
6.  The gravel and rocks will be cleared away using a shovel and crane and a crane. This will get them about 6 inches deeper into the rock. It'll be a long process to dig down to anything of value
7.  Players will be able to use the gravel for making paths, and the stones for building walls or other things

### Early metals - iron

1.  Players will be able to collect ores of a lot of different metals. Each will need a different process to refine.
2.  Iron can be smelted directly from its ore, but will give Pig Iron. This will contain a lot of carbon and silicon impurities.
3.  Pig Iron can be heated and hammered more to produce Wrought Iron. This may be a lengthy process.

### Bread Making

-   Sugar: this can be acquired from multiple sources: honey can be added directly, or Figs, Grapes and Dates can be cooked & mashed to make syrups. Later on, sugar cane can produce sugar in an easy to store manner.

### Titanium processing

1. Comes in 2 main minerals: Ilmenite, and Rutile
2. Crush & wash ore
3. Mix ore with Chlorine Gas and a carbon source (Coal Coke is ideal). Heat to 1000 decrees Celcius to make Titanium Tetrachloride. Makes impurities like Iron
4. Distill hot mixture to purify the metal liquid
5. Mix with Magnesium or Sodium in a vacuum. Result is Titanium Sponge (a very pourus rock structure) and either Magneisum Chloride of Sodium Chloride
6. Use either Vacuum Arc Remelting or Electron Beam Melting to melt Titanium Sponge into a solid titanium material
7. Forming of pure titanium can be done similarly to blacksmithing; heating the material up before shaping it
8. Popular alloy: Titanium Aluminum Vanadium; strong, lightweight and corrosion resistant

### Vacuum tube production

1.  The wire setup is created and a glass 'dome' aka tube is made. Crafting these parts is straight-forward
2.  A glass pipe is inserted into the tube and the tube is sealed, still full of air with the tube sticking out
3.  The pipe is put onto a vacuum system. It is flooded with pure oxygen, then vacuumed to suck out as much air as possible
4.  While sealed, the pipe is heated and that seals the tube
5.  An iodizer inside the tube (such as clean copper) is then heated by way of induction. Oxidization collects the remaining gas atoms inside the tube, achieving a complete vacuum

-   We don't have to know fully how the vacuum system works

### Locomotive types

-   Steam engines. These will come in various sizes, relying on solid fuels to run. They will also come in various speeds and torque ratings. Historically, steam engines did not have a transmission. They were built to run at specific torque and speed levels. To change this would require re-designing the entire locomotive.
-   Diesel engines. These will carry much heavier loads and use a transmission, but only one engine can be used per train.
-   Diesel-electric engines. These can be linked together, and are more fuel efficient.
-   Nuclear. These use nuclear fission to run. Their fuel lasts a very long time.
-   Battery. These charge at stations. Early battery trains have limited distance, but later ones fix this issue.

### Train car types

-   Standard boxcar. Can be used to hold any large items, stacked to the ceiling. Loading & unloading will be easier using boxes or crates
-   End-door boxcar. Similar to standard boxcar, but has doors on the end instead. This makes it easier to fill the car with rail pallets.
-   Flatbed car. Can be used to carry any number of unusual items, but will be exposed to the weather
-   Gaseous tank car. Carries gasses of any kind, kept under pressure. We will have many grades of gaseous tank cars, to carry
-   Sealed fluid tank car. Carries liquids of any kind, not under pressure.
-   Fast-dump fluid tank car. Carries liquids, but is set up to dump fluids much more easily
-   Auto-dump gravel car. Carries gravel type items like ore, coal, or bulk corn. Has several drain chutes at the bottom to allow dumping to a system below the tracks
-   Fast-dump gravel car. An open-top container car, also used for gravel type items. Removing its contents requires parking the car in a special rotator machine that rotates the entire car 360 degrees, dumping all the contents in one go.
-   Logger car. Has vertical bars to allow easy transportation of logs. Logs can be between 5 and 20 chunks long
-   Linked-pair car. Primarily used for carrying long railroad lines. It is really two rail cars, one start and one end. When carrying rails, these will be spread very far apart, holding the rail cargo between them, making them as long as 5 normal rail cars. When not carrying anything, they will travel next to each other and be the size of a regular car; they will not be able to travel spread out and empty, as there is no linking mechanism while loaded. These cars can be used to carry many other very-long objects, such as pipes, specialty tanks, and even some machines
-   Battery car. Stores energy for transfer between locations. Can also be used to power an electric train. Many types of this will exist, as players advance with battery tech.
-   Zoo car. Used for carrying animals of various types. Can contain food and water for them as they travel
-   Passenger car. Used to carry people; generally workers, that will be packed into seats. Luxury passenger cars can be made as well.
-   Ice car. Before refrigeration is available, this can be used to carry ice, or cold items carried with ice. Requires a lot of insulation to build. These will leak water along their path, or later models will include a tank to hold the drained water, to be dumped at their stops.
-   Refrigerated car. Used to carry items (usually food) in temperature controlled environments. Will require a refrigeration machine and have a fuel tank that needs to stay filled. Running out of fuel will result in loss of temperature control and can spoil the items it carries.
-   Gun car. Equipped with guns and carries ammo. Can be used to fend off attackers and nearby enemies, either when the train is stopped or while moving.
-   Crane car. A very large crane that can be used to unload equipment of the two cars neighboring it. This can be placed next to a linked-pair car to unload large structures
-   Forage car. Clears away vegetation that is close to the railroad tracks, to prevent foilage from overwhelming the tracks. When loaded on a train, forces the train to travel slowly.
-   Cannon car. Has a tank cannon mounted, and can fire shells at targets. Can be used while moving, but has greater accuracy (and range) when parked. Can fire in all directions, lifting the cannon above the train in order to fire forward or backward.
-   Artillery car. Carries an artillery cannon and ammo for it. The train must be parked before firing, but can hit targets at great distance
-   Power car. Runs a generator of some kind, providing electrical power to the rest of the train. This will be especially useful for luxury passenger cars.
-   Radar car. Runs a large radar that can detect aircraft. The radar can also be used to map areas surrounding your rail line as you travel.
-   Crafting car. Has space to run various machines on board to craft items while the train is in motion.
-   Communications car. Uses radio to send and receive messages between other sources (communications cars, bases, etc).
-   Kitchen car. Paired with luxury passenger cars, allows onboard workers to craft food to serve passengers.
-   Restroom car. Paired with luxury passenger cars (or any car, really), provides a place for passengers to relieve themselves
-   Missile car. Contains a battery of missiles to be used defensively, or offensively, while traveling.
-   Anti-air car. Equipped with anti-air guns, to provide defenses against enemy aircraft.
-   Pump car. When mounted next to a fluid car, can be used to load or unload fluids from that fluid car, without needing power from the local grid. However, this will require a power car or something to run the pump.
-   Flamethrower car. When mounted next to a fluid car carrying fuel, can use that fuel to shoot fire out the sides of a train. Can be a crude way of clearing vegetation at speed, but can also set forest fires to run rampant beginning from the train's path.
-   Megaphone car. Has large speakers to broadcast messages (or just play music) to communities the train passes, and at places the train stops at. Can be used to spread propaganda in areas controlled by enemy factions

### Mining

Mining materials of all kinds should be a challenge for players. Factorio made this part trivial (it more glossed over this part); but Minecraft was much too involved, while also not worrying about cave-ins or lights failing.

It may be difficult to work out a balance for this game. My best bet may be to allow players to mark areas for mining, and let the workers place structures as needed. Strip mining will be more effective in the long run; players will be able to extract 100% of the ore from a vein, but will generate a huge amount of rock byproduct, and need tons of energy. I would also like to require fluids for unlocking ores, in the same way that Py's mod does.

-   Aluminum needs Coal Gas
-   Borax needs Syngas
-   Lead needs Acetylene
-   Gold needs Cyanide
-   Nickel needs Syngas
-   Niobium needs Refined Syngas
-   Tin needs Steam
-   Titanium needs Acetylene
-   Zinc needs Aromatics

### Vein mining materials needed

This assumes that workers will dig holes deep into the ground, and then dig tunnels outward from there.

-   Methods to generate light
    -   Torches. This will be the only option for early tech. It'll be very vulnerable due to going out from lack of oxygen, can catch flammable surfaces on fire, or trigger explosions if exposed to flammable gasses. Not ideal for deep mining!
    -   Oil lamps. When materials allow, these basic lamps work longer than torches and can't catch things on fire. But they are still prone to triggering explosions if exposed to flammable gasses.
    -   Miner's lamp. These use specific gaseous fuels in an enclosed space, preventing ignition of flammable gasses. They can still go out; re-lighting these within flammable gasses will still trigger an explosion. Miners will take these to a Lighting Station if they're available.
    -   Battery lamp. These use a small battery to provide light. Very reliable! We'll offer multiple types, each lasting longer.
    -   Fixed electrical lights. Where wires can be ran, lights can be mounted to use them. These can cover very large areas
-   Food & Water, to allow miners to stay in a mine longer.
-   Structural materials. Miners will place structure posts every 4 tiles to prevent cave-ins. These will come in the form of wood, iron and steel. Man-hole locations will be
-   Lighting station - Used to re-light miner's lamps. An upgraded version will include a gas detector, to ensure nothing will ignite in the area. Basic models will just have to be placed where no gasses can generate.
-   Communications lines. These can be laid across large sections of the mine to allow workers to communicate. They are also used with elevators to signal when the elevator can be raised or lowered.
-   Rail lines. These allow mine carts to travel effortlessly through the tunnels. They can be pushed either by workers or work animals (such as a horse). Mine tunnels may need to be made taller to support larger animals
-   Power lines. Players can run power lines through the mines, providing easy lighting for areas, and power for machines where needed. Mine paths will be lengthy, and thus require higher voltage cables with transformers, some of which may be subject to catching fire.
-   Rafter stairs. Can be set up in vertical locations to let workers easily reach high and low places. These can be stacked as high as needed, but must still be touching some wall for stability.
-   Elevator shafts. Elevator systems will come in many load limits. This is the easiest way to move materials - and workers - vertically through the mine. These will require electricity, or some power system to power them. Elevators can be prone to failure, especially when over filled.
-   Water pipes. This can provide water to deep parts of a mine, to put out fires.
-   Ventillation pipes. This provides fresh air flow to deep in the mines, pushing flammable gasses out and bringing in breathable air. Later systems can recover the flammable gasses for storage.
-   Pickaxes and drills. Lets workers dig. Pickaxes will come in bronze, iron and various qualities of steel. Drills will come in many sizes, from hand held plug-in units to vehicles built only for digging.
-   Conveyor belts. These will be used to extract materials, carrying them over long distances instead of using carts. These integrate easily with mining vehicles.
-   Fire-proof suites. These firemen outfits can be used when fighting mine fires.

### Foliage regrowth

This one is a little different, as it's not directly controlled by the player

-   All land tiles will have a specific land type that nature will progress towards the tile having
-   Workers can clear lands, flood it with toxins, etc, but eventually nature will lead this land back to its original form (that being said, it could take several years in realtime to reach that, but still)
-   Structures built by the player will eventually decay into rubble, then get overrun with plants, and then convert back to the original tile type it was
-   Workers travelling across the same tile multiple times will also cause the lands to take wear damage, expecially grasslands. The effects will first remove grass items until there is none left. Once empty, the tile type will change to a muddied grass tile (we may have several iterations of this), then a full dirt tile. If these tiles are left undisturbed for a time, it will revert back to its original state
-   It may be more realistic to have tiles cycle naturally, aka trees & other plants grow and die at a steady rate. But this would become much more complex than the scope of this game should cover.

### Notes on tutorials

-   Good tutorials enagage the player as they go along
-   Complex games should spread tutorial coverage out, allowing the player to play the game for a time before introducing new concepts. Too many concepts at the start of the game leaves the players uninterested and won't learn
-   Guides during the game (to warn of impending dangers) is helpful
-   Providing documentation about subjects throughout the game is also helpful. Players can refer to them whenever needed
-   Pictures or animations can be more effective than trying to describe things

### Notes on crafting systems

-   Breaks down into 3 parts: Resource collection, crafting, and usage
-   Collection cannot be too tedious, or players will not enjoy doing it. Automation of this process will help greatly
-   Crafting needs to be engaging
-   Usage has to be important. Players don't want to spend an hour collecting & crafting boring decorations. There needs to be real benefits to completing the target crafting

### Ice skates

-   Ice skates can be a simple way to travel quickly over frozen lakes - much faster than walking through snow on the banks
-   Ice skates can be made primitively using bones... they probably won't last long though. Iron ones should be easy to produce as well, once iron is available. Steel skates will last even longer
-   Additional ice skate based equipment could be made as well, such as carts, to ferry resources over long distances on frozen lakes
-   We should give suggestions to users to produce ice skates for these roles

### Other finds

-   This should be some kind of ghost phantom monster https://imgur.com/gallery/thats-embarrassing-dyhYyRB
