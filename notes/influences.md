## Influences from other games

Settlers & Warlords is influenced by several other games I have played

### Dwarf Fortress

-   Good aspects of the game
    -   The detail of the world, even within your fortress area
    -   It is easy to assign all your dwarves work in one go
-   Bad aspects of the game

    -   Limited reach of your fortress - you even have to decide your fortress size before starting. There is no way to expand beyond the borders of your fortress
    -   No opportunities to explore the world, or raid other encampments (unless including mods). Other camps may try to raid you, but you have no options to retaliate
    -   Limited tech tree. The tech is limited to medieval - dwarves don't even have magical abilities (without mods)
    -   Limited control of resources. You don't know you're out of seeds until dwarves are trying to plant them and can't. No easy way to regulate supplies
    -   Despite mining a ton, not much rock is produced. Long mining jobs can actually be done very fast
    -   No methods of automation, unless you can create carts and railways - even that needs dwarves to manage, unless you cheat with known bugs
    -   When assigning work, dwarves won't notice it unless you already have someone capable of doing that work
    -   The chaos of it all! And the speed at which things happen. This makes a pause button essential for the survival of your fortress
    -   The uniqueness of every dwarf in the game. This adds depth to the lore of the game, but with so many dwarves you don't normally pay attention to each one.
    -   You make all the decisions of the fortress, without any suggestions from the dwarves. It might be easier if dwarves could recommend roles for each other, or buildings to craft, or other decisions - even if those decisions are ultimately a bad idea and don't solve anything.
    -   Trading with caravans is a hassle. If you don't have a broker, you can't trade. If you haven't set up a depot, you can't trade.
    -   No challenge in building vertically, besides the automation of carts (although there's a bug to remedy that). No concern for structural integrity of your layers - from what I've seen, at least. Maybe building insanely large rooms on top of each other could cause issues, I don't know
    -   No real solutions to aquifers. There is a pump solution, but it's hit or miss as to whether it'll ever work or not. Dwarves should have options to build down and seal off areas.
    -   Games seem to be over before proper defences can be created. Threats can appear inside your fortress, too - how can you prepare against that?
    -   No effective way to tell how powerful a random creature is, until you send your army in to attack it

-   Game feature suggestions for Dwarf Fortress

    -   It has a search function for tasks; however, players don't know what can be built until they have the workshops that can produce them. Dwarf Fortress should offer ways to produce target goods, even if you don't have the materials & processes available yet. This would be similar to the Minecraft mod called NotEnoughItems

-   Aspects to include in Settlers & Warlords
    -   Assigning work to specific workers isn't necessary - the game can pick one at random and it'll be fine
    -   There's lots of room to grow in complexity. Workers can be given personal equipment. Nobility positions can be considered
    -   Armies will have to be declared at some point
    -   3D world gen seems more important than ever now - but will be challenging to present clearly to players. Digging down and building up will be lots of fun, though.

### Minecraft

-   Minecraft is a game built upon a voxel world generator. So far, Settlers & Warlords is built upon a 2D grid world generator. I should try to avoid keeping it that way
-   Players new to Minecraft found it challenging to merely survive. Hunger is an issue, and takes a lot of work to mitigate. Veteran players, however, have no real trouble with basic survival, as it is very easy, once you know how.
-   Digging down to deep layers is easy, and is done frequently because you know the important materials are down there
-   Altering the world in Minecraft is very easy. You can load up 30-some stacks of cobblestone and dump it into a chest, or carry it for miles away to build something with it. It is very easy for players to alter their entire world
-   There is no need to consider structural limitations; blocks can be placed anywhere. Floating bases are entirely possible
-   Mobs are pretty static, in terms of combat. Once players are able to craft armor and weapons, they can fend off lots of monsters very easily
-   Exploration is fun, but there's only so much that can be found by the player, even in caves. It all eventually becomes repetitive

-   Aspects to include
    -   Exploration needs to be a bigger part of Settlers & Warlords

### Gregtech

Gregtech is a mod for Minecraft

-   Gregtech lacks any serious amount of weapons and armor. At the same time, there are few reasons to need any additional weapons or armor. Without new mobs, the vanilla Minecraft weapons and armor are suitable enough to fend off attacking mobs
-   The mod is very grindy. It takes a lot of resources to produce even early things. Players have to work toward larger scales if they want to produce the large items faster
-   Players don't benefit from expanding their base by all that much. Yes, you'll need to venture out to collect oil and ores, but generally, all your equipment is centralized, pulling on your primary power sources
    -   This could more be a Minecraft issue, though. There are no other people around to distribute power to. There is also the issue of keeping chunks loaded
-   A lot of effort is put into crafting circuits. Nearly every machine needs them
