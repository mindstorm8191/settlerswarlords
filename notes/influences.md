## Influences from other games

Settlers & Warlords is influenced by several other games and game mods that I have played

### Dwarf Fortress

-   Good aspects of the game
    -   The detail of the world, even within your fortress area
    -   It is easy to assign all your dwarves work in one go
-   .

-   Bad aspects of the game

    -   Limited reach of your fortress - you even have to decide your fortress size before starting. There is no way to expand beyond the borders of your fortress
    -   No opportunities to explore the world, or raid other encampments (unless including mods). Other camps may try to raid you, but you have no options to retaliate
    -   Limited tech tree. The tech is limited to medieval - dwarves don't even have magical abilities (without mods)
    -   Limited control of resources. You don't know you're out of seeds until dwarves are trying to plant them and can't. No easy way to regulate supplies
    -   Despite mining a ton, not much rock is produced. Long mining jobs can actually be done very fast
    -   No methods of automation, unless you can create carts and railways - even that needs dwarves to manage, unless you cheat with known bugs
    -   When assigning work, dwarves won't notice it unless you already have someone capable of doing that work
    -   The chaos of it all! And the speed at which things happen. This makes a pause button essential for the survival of your fortress
    -   The uniqueness of every dwarf in the game. This adds depth to the lore of the game, but with so many dwarves you don't normally pay attention to each one.
    -   You make all the decisions of the fortress, without any suggestions from the dwarves. It might be easier if dwarves could recommend roles for each other, or buildings to craft, or other decisions - even if those decisions are ultimately a bad idea and don't end up fixing the problem
    -   Trading with caravans is a hassle. If you don't have a broker, you can't trade. If you haven't set up a depot, you can't trade. If you don't set your Broker's settings right, you can't trade
    -   No challenge in building vertically, besides the automation of carts (although there's a bug to remedy that). No concern for structural integrity of your layers - from what I've seen, at least. Maybe building insanely large rooms on top of each other could cause issues, I don't know
    -   No real solutions to dig through aquifers. There is a pump solution, but it's hit or miss as to whether it'll ever work or not. Dwarves should have options to build down and seal off areas.
    -   Games seem to be over before proper defences can be created. Threats can appear inside your fortress, too - how can you prepare against that?
    -   No effective way to tell how powerful a random creature is, until you send your army in to attack it

-   Game feature suggestions for Dwarf Fortress

    -   It has a search function for tasks; however, players don't know what can be built until they have the workshops that can produce them. Dwarf Fortress should offer ways to produce target goods, even if you don't have the materials & processes available yet. This would be similar to NotEnoughItems in Minecraft, but we only want to go deep enough to show how an item can be used

-   Aspects to include in Settlers & Warlords
    -   Assigning work to specific workers isn't necessary - the game can pick one at random and it'll be fine
    -   There's lots of room to grow in complexity. Workers can be given personal equipment. Nobility positions can be considered
    -   Armies will have to be declared at some point
    -   3D world gen seems more important than ever - but will be challenging to present clearly to players. Digging down and building up will be lots of fun, though.

### Minecraft

-   Minecraft is a game built upon a voxel world generator. So far, Settlers & Warlords is built upon a 2D grid world generator. I should try to avoid keeping it that way
-   Players new to Minecraft found it challenging to merely survive, especially at night. Hunger is an issue, and takes a lot of work to mitigate. Veteran players, however, have no real trouble with basic survival, as it is very easy to do, once you know how.
-   Digging down to deep layers is easy, and is done frequently because you know the important of the materials that are down there. New players won't do this very often or very fast, but they'll shake out of that quickly.
-   Altering the world in Minecraft is very easy. You can load up 30-some stacks of cobblestone and dump it into a chest, or carry it for miles away to build something with it. It is very easy for players to alter the entire world they're in
-   There is no need to consider structural limitations; blocks can be placed anywhere. Floating bases are entirely possible
-   Mobs are pretty static, in terms of combat. Once players are able to craft armor and weapons, and understand how to fight each creature type, fighting monsters is very easy
-   Modern Minecraft seems to be about questing until you get the best armor, and then there's nothing in the game that can hurt you
-   Exploration is fun, but there's only so much that can be found by the player, even in caves. It all eventually becomes repetitive

-   Take-aways
    -   Exploration needs to be a bigger part of Settlers & Warlords
    -   Digging down into the earth should be challenging. Lighting methods should be temporary. Access to oxygen should be a concern. Hauling resources out of the mines should take a lot of effort.
    -   Moving blocks of land should not be simple. Rocks should take up space whether mined away or not

### Gregtech

Gregtech is a mod for Minecraft. It is heavily tech focused with a very long tech tree. I have played this mod for many years trying to access the top tier machines, and have yet to succeed at it.

-   Gregtech lacks any serious amount of weapons and armor. At the same time, there are few reasons to need any additional weapons or armor. Without new mobs, the vanilla Minecraft weapons and armor are suitable enough to fend off any threats, and a reasonable defensive wall is enough to keep your machines safe
-   The mod is very grindy. It takes a lot of resources to produce even early things. Players have to work toward larger scales if they want to produce the large items faster, and Gregtech does not provide any tools to make scaling any easier.
-   Players don't benefit from expanding their base by all that much. Yes, you'll need to venture out to collect oil and ores, but generally, all your equipment is centralized, pulling on your primary power sources
    -   This could more be a Minecraft issue, though; there are no other people around to distribute power to. There is also the issue of keeping chunks loaded
-   A lot of effort is put into crafting circuits. Even basic machines need them
-   For everything this mod adds to the game, there are no simple ways to automate ore collection. Advancement is often limited to how much of a given ore you can bring home - sometimes advancement depends specifically on having that ore type. Powered hand drills make ore collection faster, but it's still a manual process. Automatic drill mining only becomes available in mid-late game. The ability to collect ore in bulk, automatically, is considered very OP. This can make crafting big-ticket items even more challenging
-   Some aspects of Gregtech are intentionally not automation-friendly, requiring the player to spend more time managing mundane tasks. I think this leads to the idea that Gregtech is grindy.

### Civilization 6

I downloaded this game when it was on sale once. I didn't play much of it, though

-   Fog of War is present, but incomplete. Any troops you have in a given area can tell you what's gonig on, in real time
-   Much effort is put into climbing a tech tree (and culture tree), but it boils down to reasearch points. No application of said technology is to advance in that direction. It's an old design
-   Army attack strength never weakens as toops take damage. The game shows your units dying in battle, yet the remaining units attack just as strongly
-   A lot of effort has been put into accessible documentation for new users. Yet, it still seems incomplete. I had built a battering ramp to attack a walled city, but the game wouldn't let me use it, and gave no explanation as to why. The documentation didn't show any info about battering rams specifically. It is important to show users errors in what they wish to do, and explain how to solve them.

Take-aways

-   Troops stationed in remote locations should not have direct contact with the player. They should have the ability to send messengers every now and then, to keep the player updated on their contition. Players can send messages to the troops to give orders (relocate, attack something, return, etc). Beyond that, though, players will not know what is happening to remote troops unless & until a messenger can send word to them, or an outbound messenger reports their absense, or a scheduled response never arrives.
-   Keeping the game accessible to users will be very critical. Documentation should build up as players progress through the game, giving them time to learn mechanics as they are added, and serve as a reference
-   We haven't done much in terms of figuring out combat yet; we should explore that some more.

### Factorio

I recently purchased this game, knowing this game will be similar in nature to it. "It's for research!"... this is triggering a lot of changes to my game.

-   Good aspects
    -   New construction processes are always built upon existing ones. You have to make sure that existing processes don't stop working due to adding new consumers of the needed resources.
    -   Trains are fun. Managing the flow of multiple trains on the same rail network is an interesting logistics problem. The rail signals are very helpful in keeping trains from running into each other
    -   Robots allow you to automate the growth of your factory (to some level), and blueprints make that process much faster. Being able to pick up a chunk of buildings, and place them someplace else is quite helful, even if it takes some time for robots to do the work, and get them running again.
    -   Conveyor belts running resources around makes management of resources and crafting much easier. It is also appealing to see your resources flow (or not flow if there are problems). Conveyor belts also provide ways to filter resources to where you need them.
    -   Biters are a nuisiance, but also an important game mechanic
        -   Biters move very fast; players are pretty much sitting ducks compared to them, even when armed with weapons. Vehicles help your survival, but only if you can keep moving. Therefore you have to rely heavily on base defenses to defeat Biters
        -   Player bases are very large, so you can't always be at a place where Biters attack you. This forces players to rely on fixed defenses; players end up investing a lot of resources and effort into building, maintaining and upgrading defeses for your entire perimeter. Any failures can lead to the destruction of entire sections of your base
        -   Biters encourage players to be mindful of the air pollution they generate. The more you pollute, the faster that the Biters grow in strength
        -   Reaching out further with your base means attackign Biter bases. The futher out you go, the larger each Biter Base becomes. Attacking Biter bases means they'll send fresh Biters to attack your base
    -   There's a lot of emphasis on automation. Machines just work. Just provide them power, input goods and an output belt, and they will continue to work. Machines will let you select recipes and only accept those items as input.
-   .

-   Bad aspects
    -   Many processes are glossed over
        -   Circuit production literally needs only iron plates and copper wire in an assembler machine for basic circuits. The production chain of many other resources is very simplified.
        -   Material processing; you mine metal ores directly from the surface, toss it into a furnace and now you have metal, already in plate form.
        -   There are only 6 types of resources to collect from the world (coal, stone, iron, copper, oil and uranium)
        -   Later game items aren't that much more complex, requiring only a few different items.
        -   There are no big-ticket items, and very few pre-components (only gears, it seems). There should be more layers to building automated parts
    -   The only tasks that demand automation is research, and the materials needed for science packs. A large portion of things can simply be crafted by the player directly, if you're patient enough. For small-quantity items, it is always easier to craft by hand, instead of creating a suitable process system to build it for you
    -   Machines never break or need replacement parts. Once you build it, you always have it
    -   Power production is a minor component of the game. Keep fuel going to your boilers, and you'll be set. If you're not making enough power, your machines will merely operate slower, there is nothing that will completely stop. There are no power-intense operations to worry about.
    -   Power distribution is glossed over. You only need to place down electrical poles, and everything in range will receive power. Everything can be powered by the same copper wire, no matter how power-hungry your base becomes
    -   Conveyor systems don't require power of any kind
    -   Nearly all construction processes take place in one type of machine: the Assembling Machine. A few later recipes using fluids require a chemical plant, but solid items are down to one device.
    -   Beginner resources are plentiful, that you get from your crashed ship. It takes a long time before you need to venture out and gather fresh items, when it is perfectly possible to start playing from having nothing in your inventory at all.
    -   Players are discouraged from running lots of pipes, because they cannot travel over them. Underground pipes only hide the true routing of pipes you have set up.
        -   Pipes should have some kind of upgrade that lets you travel over them, even if you move slower when doing so
    -   There is only one pipe type, that can carry any liquid at all, no matter how corrosive.
    -   Some (later) game elements are poorly explained. I had to experiment a while and Google some too before I could learn how to load & unload fluid trains. Their tips & tricks section seems buggy; hopefully they'll fix it
    -   Players don't need to worry about food, water, sleep, shelter, anything
    -   Construction bots makes repair of your base very easy. As long as you have bots, repair packs and replacement items, you can rebuild from nearly any Biter attack, if it doesn't destroy your Roboport.
    -   Bots are only useful at a small scale. When bots need to cover large areas, travel between locations becomes extremely slow. Bots that become open for work can't relieve bots traveling from far away. It becomes better to work with smaller bot network areas.
    -   Players can carry huge amounts of materials. A whole stack of giant buildings is nothing to worry about.
        -   Player carrying capacity should be limited or not existing. Instead, players can haul building components to a build site (via vehicles of many kinds), then build the machine there over a span of time
-   .

-   Take-aways
    -   Machines should be expensive to build. Big machines should be like mini-bosses, and require automation of crafting its components to complete. Machines that unlock new capabilities should require new levels of power to feed them
    -   Conveyor belts should be available early in the game, and require power. Motor points should be used to drive conveyor belt systems. Belts and motor points can be upgraded over time for larger loads.
        -   Conveyor belts should be powered by just about everything, starting from a water wheel, and can be made entirely out of wood (for light materials only)
        -   Belts will have weight limits. Multiple motor points on the same system can be used to drive heavier loads. Belts themselves will have max limits, too
        -   Conveyor belts should be more efficient than having workers move items everywhere manually. Considering workers can only move items one at a time, that shouldn't be hard to do, if you're trying to scale up productions
        -   Belt sorting and picking can be done manually by workers, for a time. We can automate this later
        -   Players should be able to build conveyor belts over & under each other. We should have a means for belts to send items up or down whole tile blocks
    -   Trains will be fun to add to the game - so long as we can fully automate them.
        -   Trains shouldn't be limited to mid-late game technology. Instead, we will use Horse Trains. They will be manned by teams of workers, tasked with transporting goods between places at fixed intervals. They'll be much more expensive than trains to operate, but be available from much earlier tech.
        -   Trains should come in a variety of power levels. We will probably start with steam trains, and work our way up
    -   Research has positives and negatives; see the Research Process file in the notes here.
    -   Seamless maps NEEDS to be a thing. Even with 3D map layouts, factory bases will probably get extremely large. The challenge will be how to handle so much land at once in this environment.
    -   Workers should be slowed down if they are carrying a heavy crafting component. Machines should be created to help move specific item types around
    -   Follow Gregtech's approach to circuit manufacturing. After vacuum tubes, players will be challenged with running a furnace at specific temperature for over a minute. They will need a vacuum tube computer to control heat input
        -   In-game, each furnace built this way will have a randomly selected heat loss rate
    -   Circuits should expand in two vectors: Complexity and power levels. Important machinery will use both; the complex chip to control operations, and high power chips to run motors and such. These chips will be build with entirely different processes.
    -   Factorio seems to put a limit on the extent of design in their game. That is something I need to do with this, but haven't yet.
    -   Frequent raids by neighboring civilizations should be normal. The most common trigger should be air / water pollution. It can also be triggered by players taking resources from their territories. Players will need to set up defenses very early on, using workers with basic weaponry.
        -   Raiders will sometimes be satisfied after stealing a sufficient level of materials

### Space Exploration

Space Exploration is a Factorio mod, which I installed shortly after beating regular Factorio

-   Good aspects
    -   Provides a legitimate reason to ramp up the size of your base. Cargo rockets are expensive, and supplying off-world outposts is also challenging
    -   Travel to remote planets is costly, especially for early players. This forces you to set up proper base defenses, and have your resource flow stable, so that you are able to spend enough time at these outposts to get things set up like you need them
    -   Encourages relying on robots to expand your base and move resources around. If you can get yourself set up correctly, you can manage base growth remotely, along with crafting new components to your bases, without ever having to be on those planets.
-   Bad aspects
    -   There is no orbital movement of the planets. All travel generally takes the same amount of time. If you are flying in the rocket, travel is instantaneous from the end of a launch to the start of a landing.
    -   There are more things to make, but not a lot of new ores to collect. But the existing ores gives you reason to travel to other planets.
    -   Many of the high tech stuff in normal Factorio is pushed deeper into Space Exploration's tech tree. Some of this is reasonable, and creates incentive to research the higher tech areas. But there are no new ideas to 'better' the technologies normal Factorio can provide
    -   Travelling to new planets is challenging, in the way that you must gather all the resources you need to do so, and you never know what to bring. If you forget something that you can't make on the new planet, well, you're kinda stuck. The 500-slot cargo rocket leaves lots of room for customizing your trip, but then makes it that much harder to decide what to bring
    -   Power failures of your remote bases can often leave them stranded with no way to get running again. Depending on the planet, solar isn't even usable. If your power levels are sitting at zero, your base can't even unload new shipments of fuels

### Pyanodon's Mod

Py's Mod is another Factorio mod, which I played after trying Space Exploration. Like S-E, it is a full overhaul mod, giving players a new experience from the beginning

-   Good aspects
    -   This mod focuses on making production processes very complex. My Factorio complaints about how simple circuit production is has been answered by this mod; you need dozens of machines and materials to build circuits. The mod behaves like this on everything else. Even crafting science packs is a major endeavor
    -   Lots of new ores to utilize. Early game gives you access to Aluminum - but requires feeding Coal Gas to a new miner to access the ore
    -   Ore processing starts simple, but gets more complex as you progress through the mod, as new materials, structures and processes become available
    -   Byproducts become a burden if you don't manage processing them, but they are also necessary to advance through science
    -   Animals are bred and provide essential resources for advancement
    -   Vacuum states are handled as just another type of gas. This makes it easier to work with, and doesn't go against the grain
-   .

-   Bad aspects
    -   Ores are everwhere; so much so that it's impossible to not build on top of them. Many times you are better off reaching out to target ores, instead of trying to fully utilize ores that are closer to home; the space is more valuable than the materials
    -   Many sub-processes can get unlocked through science research, but doesn't affect your base operations. The only thing really pushing for building these new processes is new Science Packs that require those specific resources
    -   A lot of byproducts don’t have uses when they are unlocked, while other products of that recipe are needed. You are forced to dispose of them, or store large amounts if they are deemed valuable later on. Disposal of liquids go into a ‘giant underground cavern’ (I dislike this idea); for gasses it’s a smoke stack to release it into the air (this doesn’t contribute to pollution levels).
    -   Heated materials are a part of this mod, but never lose their heat until used in a recipe. Players routinely haul around Hot Air via trains, as a fluid, because it's just easier to manage that way
    -   Many buildings are massive, and extremely tall. The size isn't much of a concern, but design can be challenging for tall buildings - you can't see any equipment on the back side of them
-   .

-   Take-aways
    -   Gasses and liquids should be handled differently. Gasses should require a fully enclosed pipe, with pressure values. Breaks in pipes should lead to complete loss of that gas. Liquids should be fine with open-top pipes, so long as it doesn't overflow
    -   Coal gas should be used for glassmaking and other purposes. Home heating will be needed as well. Building underground may not work well for most species, as it is too cold
    -   Early-game tech should give access to coal, and can be refined in a dirt pit, much like how wood is turned into charcoal. This will give access to tar as a liquid; coal gasses will escape. Later machines will allow us to capture that, too.
    -   Py's mod adds a lot of new creatures and plants to produce additional (necessary) resources. We should use the same ideas
    -   Distillation of fluids should take place early on, and with a variety of different machines (and results). The earliest machines could only allow gaseous byproducts and remaining fluid byproducts (which can then be distilled again)
    -   Materials processing should follow Pyanodon's approach; early processing is merely smelting ores to get metals. New processes unlock as you go, each one being more complex but yielding more metals per ore.
    -   Recycling of machines and tools should be a thing, to get back materials you spent on crafting things you no longer need
    -   When we build a Distillation tower (for cracking Coal, of course), the graphics should include some text saying Pyanodon, as a nod to this mod.
