# Magic System

Magic will be a big part of this game. Players will need to learn about it, and put it to use in some way or other, as there will be many NPC creatures that use it heavily.

Deciding what to base this magic system on has been difficult. I have seen many different magic-based systems in games, books and movies. One thing I would like to avoid is where only select few people can access and use it; for example, the Jedi of Star Wars, the Aes Sedai of The Wheel of Time, the Silver-bloods of Red Queen, and even the various magic-weilders of Mistborn. While all these are unique and interesting, they require specialists in their fields.

I am opting to follow most closely with a Minecraft mod called Thaumcraft. All items & materials have magical apects to them which can be extracted, and many items can be imbued with magical properties to improve performance.

Magical creatures in this game will have pre-existing magical properties, but players will be able to imitate or duplicate the powers and effects these creatures possess, through the use of items.

There is a lot left to figure out with this magical system. I am open to ideas others may have
