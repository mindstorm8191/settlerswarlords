## Settlers & Warlords Monetization Strategies

Although my primary focus here is to make a fun, enjoyable game, I plan to eventually monetize it. But there are many options to make it work.

The primary motivation for players to purchase bonuses will be to produce critical resources faster. Players may need food for their armies, or weapons & armor, or even lumber to build weaponry. The game will not ever force players to use monetization to advance in the game. They will always have the option of creating the processes to craft the resources they need.

### Option 1: purchaseable processes

Players will be able to purchase processes from the game, which provides essential resources the player will need. The number of processes will be limited, and need to be designed first. How these processes work will not be shared

### Option 2: player-based economy

The economy will work by certain players offering processes to other players, in the form of contraptions.

-   The contraption-provider player (the seller) will declare a section of their map as being a contraption, and it can be posted on a market, which other players can browse and purchase from.
-   Buyer players will have the contraption dropped onto their lands, where it will begin working right away.
-   Seller players will have to specify what inputs (if any) are required, what outputs are provided, and how to control their contraption. Many contraptions will require power. These can either be an input which must be provided, or a portion of the contrpation will be devoted to power production.
-   Resources needed for operations can be stacked into the contraption, taking as much room as needed.
-   Contraptions being sold cannot include the contraptions of another player, in whole or in part.
-   Contraptions will not show buyer players how they function.
-   Buyer players will be able (and encourated) to give these contraptions a rating, which will be shown to other potential buyers.
-   Buyer players will need to pay a steady fee for the use of the contraptions. We will probably go with a weekly charge.
-   Once the week has elapsed, the contraption will reset; any resources inside the contraption will be replaced
-   Buyer players won't be auto-charged for a following-week use of the contraption. They will have to specify to continue using it. They will get the option of resuming use on the last day. If the contraption's use ends while they are away, they will be asked upon login if they wish to keep using it.
-   The buyer player will earn money from the use of their contraption by other players. The game will take a portion of those earnings; I haven't decided how much of a cut it will be, though.
