# Research Processes

Factorio uses a research system to allow players to advance to new machines. Players must craft Science Packs (composed of various items recently unlocked) and then have them processed in a Research Lab. I believe there are 6 different packs; later tech advancements require multiple quantities of the earlier science packs, along with the new ones.

Factorio's research system has some benefits; namely it encourages players to scale up production of various resources that the science packs need. It also provides a basic way to lock items and processes away from players until they have completed the required research. Players can sometimes focus in on unlocking key technologies, changing how they advance through the game.

One of the drawbacks of Factorio's research system is that it encourages players to focus entirely on scaling up the resources for research, and not much else. If you can mass produce the items required for research, you can manually craft everything else.

Pyanodon's mod halfway addresses this issue because it has so many different research levels. Also, each new science pack requires drawing resources from nearly every portion of your base; science packs are very expensive when you first unlock them.

I am not sure where I stand on research at this time. I was planning to have a research system where, for example, to unlock better quality gasoline engines, you would have to send engines in for research, and not much else. Research topics would be more focused on individual items, instead of creating bundled items for broad ranges of science.

Now, I am not so sure. My above method wouldn't do much to encourage scaling up of specific items that much, because why scale up when you'll just have to tear it down after research is done? We need something to encourage players to scale up the production rates of items, but I am not sure in what way to do that.

Gregtech took an entirely different approach. Instead of research, many items were wildy expensive. You could technically craft Tungstensteel and the things it's used for at the start of any game. But you would need an extreme voltage Electrolyzer first, be able to run it without power interruption for the 10 seconds it needs, and then also run the Electric Blast Furnace at high voltage for the 1 1/4 minutes needed to produce the ingot. All machines were expensive material-wise - and you were encouraged to build them to save on material costs. For example, you could use a hammer to manually turn 4 Tungstensteel Ingots into 2 plates, then wire cutters to turn 2 plates into 1 wire. But with a wiremill of correct voltage, you could turn those 4 Tungstensteel Ingots into 8 wire, instead of 1.

This is still something to think about...
