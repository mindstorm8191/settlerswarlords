# Settlers & Warlords Tech Tree

Settlers & Warlords is expected to have a complex tech tree, even before being able to access metals. This is a semi description of the path which players will take

1. Build lean-tos for early shelter
2. Build a forage post to collect local foods. The local environment will have a surplus of foods, but will quickly be drained; from there, food will trickle in from this. Plants will need to be cultivated to provide more food
3. Build a rock knapper building, make flint knives & stabbers; your first tools.
4. Build a Forest Post to collect Twine Strips. Twine can be collected from decaying tree bark using a Flint Knife. Freshly cut trees can also produce twine, but the bark must be soaked in water first (30 minutes sounds reasonable).
5. Twine Strips will unlock a Rope Maker that converts twine into rope. Thicker and longer ropes can be crafted from two of the lower-level types; we will only consider the final used rope as un-editable.
6. A Flint Stabber can be used at the Forest Post to cut long & short sticks. With rope, this can be used to craft a Flint Hoe, Hatchet, Spear and Scythe. Players won't need to see the individual tool heads for these.
7. A Flint Scythe will unlock a Farmer's Post that allows collecting grasses. A knife can be used to separate the grain from the straw, at the same structure. Straw with 1 rope can be used for making Thatch roofing.
8. Any grain will unlock a Milling Station (research how to mill grains without a millstone, or how a Mortar & Pestle can be made).
9. Thatch Roofing unlocks a Drying Space, built with 4 poles, 5 long sticks, 20 Thatch Roof tiles. This will first be used to dry clay bricks, for a kiln.
10. Farmer's Post can also be unlocked by a Flint Hoe. Clearing grasses can locate seeds of random crops. A farmer's post can clear lands for farming, where the seeds can be planted. Players can collect crops from tiles; some rare crops will grow on single tiles of the map (this needs to be added to localmap generation)
11. Flint Hatchet allows cutting down trees from the Forest Post. Full logs cannot be moved, but can be cut down further.
    - 3 connected log = 4 poles
    - 1 connected log = 1 pole
    - 1 pole = 3 long sticks
    - 1 long stick = 2 short sticks
    - 1 connected log = 4 heavy planks
    - connected logs can be separated to become log chunks
    - 1 log chunk = 1 wood butcket
    - 1 log chunk = 7 firewood cuts (must be dried before burning)
12. Wooden Bucket unlocks a Water Source, where Wooden Buckets can be filled with water in 5 game ticks (aka fast)
13. Water Bucket unlocks a Mixing Station. Adding dirt to a water bucket and then mixing will produce bits of clay.
    - 5 Clay Bits = 1 Clay Ball
    - 2 Clay Balls can be molded into 1 Wet Clay Brick. These must be dried in a Drying Space, and then they can be used to build a Kiln.
    - 1 Clay Ball can be molded into 1 Wet Clay Bucket, which also needs to be dried and fired
14. Flint spear will unlock a Hunter's Post. Like with foraging, existing supplies will diminish quickly. Chance of hunting success will start at 50%, and lose 1% for every successful hut. It will regain 1% every hour; the only long-term solution is via livestock & husbandry. There will be a 5% chance of the hunter coming back late & injured, and a 5% chance they don't come back at all (they died). Game animals will depend on the biome the player is in
    - Grasslands: chicken, deer, wolves, bison, cows, turkeys
    - Forests: wolves, deer, bears, mountain lions, raccoons, sheep, goats, eagles, owls
    - Desert: hyenas, lions, camels, owls, rabbits, meerkats
15. A successful hunt will unlock Pastures for livestock. Fences can be made from lots of poles, long sticks & rope. Livestock can be kept inside them. The space of the Pasture will increase in size with more Fence sections.
16. Flint Spears will also unlock a Lasso at the Rope Maker, costing 16 small rope. This can be taken along while hunting. There will be a 10% chance of bringing home a live large animal, if a hunt is successful. Potential large animals include cows, bison, hog, horse, sheep, mule, etc. These will need to be kept in Pastures to keep alive. Damage to the pastures can occur frequently and require repair. Pastures can only hold one animal type, bigger pastures holding more of them. The animals will require regular feeding to keep them alive. With steady food supply, they'll reproduce. Offspring will be more tame, and less likely to damage the Pasture. Animals can still die of old age.
17. A successful hunt will unlock the Fire Pit. Vegetation will need to be cleared first. Firewood can be cut from decayed logs, using up Debarked Logs first. A Drying Space can turn fresh wood into usable firewood. Animals can be cooked whole, but takes longer and produces less cooked meat, and no byproducts.
18. A successful hunt will also unlock a Butcher's Shop. A Flint Knife can be used to separate skin, bone, meat and even feathers.
19. Any Bone will unlock a Bone Carver's Shop. The first use of this will be to make Bone Needles and other sewing tools.
20. A Bone Needle will unlock a Clothier's Shop. Animal Skins can be crafted into clothes of all kinds, as well as carrying sacks. Skins can also be cleaned to start producing leather (need to research the leather-making process).
21. Animal skins and a clay bucket will unlock a Tanner's Shop, for producing leather. Tannins come from various tree barks and plant seeds, and can be leeched out by boiling those things. This produces a dilluted tannis mixture. This can be boiled down to produce a concentrated tannis mixture. Animal skins are placed in this for 6-12 months (we'll call this 1 hour of game time) and gives you leather.
22. Leather opens up more production options at the Clothier's Shop, for working with leather. Most notably Leather Gloves
23. Leather Gloves unlocks clearing options at the Forest Post. You can then use a knife and gloves to remove thorny bushes from the surrounding lands.
24. Cut Meats will unlock the Meat Smoker, which will cook meats slower than the Fire Pit, but they'll remain edible for longer.
25. Grains and Spears will unlock a Small Animal Trap. Traps can be taken along while hunting and set up. Upon a (separate) successful hunt, there will be a 50% chance of the trap catching something, and a 25% chance of the catch still being alive when brought home. Every usage attempt will require additional seeds taken along in order to catch something.
26. Grains and Spears will also unlock a Chicken Coop. It is built with poles, long sticks and ropes. Once chickens are inside, a steady supply of grains will produce eggs. Eggs left in the Coup has a 50% chance to hatch.
27. Planks and poles will open up paddle wheels, the first automated power source. This must be set up along streams of some kind. This can be used to move items automatically (some heavy), and to mill wheat. This could also be used to cut wood faster, using a flint-bladed saw. All this will require lots of parts, some recyclable. Power can be transfered some distances, as well.
28. Wood poles can be used to build a crude crane, that can be used to lift heavy objects (though slowly).
29. A Wooden Crane will unlock the Fire Miner. Workers will use hoes to dig down to rock, then use fire and water to bust rocks. Hoes will be used to clear rubble, and a crane can move/ remove larger rocks. When deep enough, the crane will be used to move transport items & workers in & out of the hole.
30. True ore collection will depend on travel to different map tiles. Players will have to establish enough tech there to mine ores. Players won't know what is in any tile until they dig there. Many ores will be useless to new players (or at least be more valuable when at later tech, meaning using early processes isn't productive).
31. Many different metals wil have different uses in early tech; we will try to follow ideas from Dwarf Fortress
    - Copper: fairly maleable. Will suffice for armor and swords, but is not very effective
    - Tin: rather brittle. As armor, will be easy to split
    - Lead: Heavy and very maleable
    - Iron: This is the easiest metal to produce weapons & armor with. It is still brittle on its own
32. Pure iron can be used first, but will be brittle and limited to only some tools.
33. Copper and tin will both be necessary for early tech. Smelting it together will give Bronze. Early Bronze production will be slow & tedious, many early Bronze tools will be Flint tools dipped in molten bronze
34. New Bronze tools will provide better ways to cut wood, making products from wood cost less time and wood, and creating more wood based items
35. As bronze production grows, weapons and armor can be equipped with it. Later bronze can provide low pressure steam production, for a variety of new machines.
36. Eventually players will be able to smelt iron using charcoal or coal, producing steel. This will require better abilities in alloy production control, along with enough automated power to keep air flowing through a Smelter the whole time

After playing Factorio (and Py's mod) for some time, I think this game would be better off to have two game modes: easy and hard. I will continue developing plans for hard mode, following the above tech path. Easy mode will simplify the tech tree by a great deal, and be easier for players to get into the game and advance through it.
