# Settlers & Warlords Means of War

1. Even early players will be able to equip their people with weapons. A Flint spear, knife and wooden shield can be effective when there is enough troops
2. Bronze will bring a revolution in army weaponry. Bronze swords will be first to be crafted. Shields and helmets will boost defensive standards
3. Wrought iron will be used for even better weapons, also providing chain mail and plate mail armor types. Steel will provide the same, but better and lighter
4. Chemicals will lead the way for gunpowder, along with better explosives. Rifles and cannons will cause major army changes just from gunpowder. Higher explosives will change armies even more.
5. Motorized vehicles will provide trucks, then tanks, enabling better use of explosives for battle. Machine guns will be critical here too
6. Circuitry uses in combat will cause big changes in combat as well. Missiles will become standard, as well as drones
