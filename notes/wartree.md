# Settlers & Warlords Means of War

Combat and wars will still happen in Settlers & Warlords. Here are some plans I have in place

1. Battles will take place as though no players are online. A player attacking another location will not have any opportunity to control the battle. A player who is online will only have limited control of a battle; the amount of control and options have not yet been determined
2. All player workers will be involved in defending their camp, when they are attacked. Even if there are no weapons, workers will utilize Flint Stabbers, Flint Knives, or even go bare handed to fight.

-   Players will control have the ability to control army groups. These can be ordered to travel to certain locations and perform operations there.
-   The only means to control army groups is by way of messengers. The player may send a message to an army's known location to perform new actions. The armies may also send messengers back to the player to report any unexpected activities, their status, etc
-   Armies will keep their own inventory. Their carrying capacity will be limited by what items they are using to carry other things. Pack horses will be used frequently for raiding parties, to bring items home, not to mention supplies to get there & back
-   Armies can be split apart and merged as needed, by way of orders. An army may utilize a rail line to send trains back & forth for receiving supplies and returning loot
-   Armies can be attacked at any point, and may change course after doing so. As an example, an army is heading from a north location to an east location, and gets attacked. Their orders may be to return home if >50% of troops are lost, and they do so. Any messages sent to this army will assume they are still moving to the desired location. The messenger may wait a while at the target location, but come home reporting that the message wasn't delivered.
-   Messenger deliveries may become intercepted as well. Enemy players may be able to extract information from these messengers, using it for their own gain. A player sending messages won't know a message is delivered successfully or not until the messenger returns home... or is reported as missing.
-   Armies can be given time limits to be away from the safety of a city. If no messages are received by the set duration, they will return to a specific city

Army makeup will change as the player's tech level progresses

1. Even early players will be able to equip their people with weapons. A Flint spear, knife and wooden shield can be effective when there is enough troops
    - Most early armies will travel by foot to their destination
    - Travel range will be limited by their carrying capacity of food
    - Their weapon choices will be spears, hatchets and knives, made from flint. Wooden shields will be useful here, too
2. Army makeup will change when livestock becomes available
    - Armies will use horses to move small forces at much faster speeds. Messages can also be sent much faster using horses.
    - Pack animals will enable a much greater amount of goods to move into battle, and loot to bring back
    - Some fantasy creatures may be useful during combat, increasing an army's battle effectiveness
3. Bronze will bring a revolution in army weaponry. Bronze swords will be first to be crafted. Shields and helmets will boost defensive standards
4. Wrought iron will be used for even better weapons, also providing chain mail and plate mail armor types. Steel will provide the same, but better and lighter
5. Chemicals will lead the way for gunpowder, along with better explosives. Rifles and cannons will cause major army changes just from gunpowder. Higher explosives will change armies even more.
6. Electricity will open up the use of radio, allowing messages to be sent over increasingly longer distances. However, other players may be able to hear the same signals.
7. Steam engines will first be used for railroad, opening the ability to move resources at increasingly greater speed and ranges. However, this will require the development of lands where the railroads run
8. Motorized vehicles will provide trucks, then tanks, enabling better use of explosives for battle. Machine guns will be critical here too
9. Circuitry uses in combat will cause big changes in combat as well. Missiles will become standard, as well as drones
