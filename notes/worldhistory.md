# Settlers & Warlords - World History

This game is to be set on a wild and unexplored world. I would like players to encounter a history of the world, but in a very natural way. Players will be able to discover ancient structures (crumbling to the ground), and can occasionally find old weapons that were lost on ancient battlefields.

Many of these ancient artifacts will be useless compared to what they were used for, but contain a lot of secrets that can be discovered.

For example, an ancient sword may have been enchanted with freezing abilities, but the years being neglected has destoryed this ability in the weapon. With enough research into the ancient relics, players will discover ways to restore these weapons and use them again.

Ancient structures can also contain forgotten magical treasures. Most of them will be broken as well, but can be restored with enough knowledge on the subject

I will probably have to create some kind of language for the ancient people to speak, or multiple languages (since the basis of the ruins are due to wars).

Ultimately I would like to provide a rich history to the world, but give no direct indications as to what that is. Players will have to discover it as they go, and figure it out. It can be a big mystery that needs to be solved.
