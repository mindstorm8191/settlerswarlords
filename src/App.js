                Guess what? We're starting version 7! Maybe I AM a little crazy... but nevermind that. After spending a lot of time on version 6, I started to
                realize things weren't as fun as I had wanted it to be. I wanted resource production to be tetious, but this was TOO tedious. This time, work
                will be centered around a per-worker level. Workers are assigned tasks (or a series of tasks) and they determine how to accomplish that. This
                may feel a lot more like Dwarf Fortress, but I don't mind.
