# Settlers & Warlords Tech Tree

Settlers & Warlords is expected to have a complex tech tree, even before being able to access metals. This is a semi description of the path which players will take

1. Build lean-tos for early shelter
2. Build a forage post to collect local foods. The local environment will have a surplus of foods, but will quickly be drained; from there, food will trickle in from this
3. Build a rock knapper building, make flint knives & stabbers.
4. Collect twine and sticks. Build a hatchet, hoe, and spear.
5. Flint hoe opens up farming, but will take a lot of time & energy to grow things. The footage post can be used by the farmers to find seeds
6. Flint hatchet opens up wood cutting, using a lumberjack's post. Cutting down trees with a hatchet will also take lots of time & energy. Full logs cannot be moved, but can be cut down further.
    - 1 log = 4 crude poles
    - 1 pole = 3 long sticks
    - 1 long stick = 2 short sticks
    - 1 log = 4 heavy planks
    - 1 log = 6 log chunks (movable by hand)
    - 1 log chunk = 1 wood bowl
    - 1 log chunk = 7 firewood cuts (must be dried before burning)
7. Flint spear will open up hunting. Like with foraging, existing supplies will diminish quickly; the only long term source will be farming. Hunting ventures won't always be successful; when they are, there will be a lot of food, until it starts rotting. Preservation methods will allow food to last longer, once the tech is available.
8. Planks and poles will open up paddle wheels, the first automated power source. This must be set up along streams of some kind. This can be used to move items automatically (some heavy), and to mill wheat. This could also be used to cut wood faster, using a flint-bladed saw. All this will require lots of parts, some recyclable. Power can be transfered some distances, as well.
9. Wood poles can be used to build a crude crane. This will allow fire mining to be unlocked. Workers will use hoes to dig down to rock, then use fire and water to bust rocks. Hoes will be used to clear rubble, and a crane can move/ remove larger rocks. When deep enough, the crane will be used to move gravel out of the mine, along with workers & firewood
10. Flint hoes will also enable collection of clay. Clay can be molded into bricks, must be dried under a rain proof shelter. Once dried (about 30 bricks), they can build a kiln, able to smelt metals from ores
