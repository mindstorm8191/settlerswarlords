# Underground Biomes

- Dwarf Fortress had several layers of underground biomes. We could achieve the same thing; deeper underground biomes would be more dangerous and lively
- Save tree growth for the deeper biomes only; higher biomes won't support them (without human intervention)
- Many plants will grow right on top of ores, which gives them unique qualities. Many animals will seek these plants for their nutrition
- Plants which rely on radiation from around then would probably grow in much different patterns than surface plants
- We might have 1 or 2 plants that will grow underground or on the surface; they will be hybrid plants that can feed from either source. They will mostly be found in ravines, where any other plants don't do so well
- All underground biomes will rely on ambient heat and (maybe) radiation to fuel them. Deeper biomes will provide more radiation
- Players will be able to mine radioactive ores and minerals, and use it fuel man made gardens that can be built anywhere
